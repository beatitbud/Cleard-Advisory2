## 📝 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Set up real Supabase project and update credentials
2. Configure Sentry auth token in Vercel
3. Set up Google Analytics with real measurement ID
4. Configure email service for notifications

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement real-time chat with Socket.io backend
2. Add more comprehensive E2E tests
3. Set up monitoring dashboards
4. Implement automated backup strategy
