## Date: 2025-08-07
## Git Tag: auth-working-v1.0
## Commit: 261d5d8

## Summary
Successfully fixed the authentication redirect issue. The login system is now fully functional with proper client-side routing after successful authentication.

## Key Changes Made
1. **Server Action Fix** (`/app/login/actions.ts`)
   - Changed from using `redirect()` to returning `{ success: true }`
   - Follows Next.js App Router best practices for server actions with useTransition

2. **Client-Side Redirect** (`/app/login/page.tsx`)
   - Added client-side redirect handling using `router.push('/dashboard')`
   - Added console logging for debugging

## Working Features
- ✅ User login with email or username
- ✅ Password validation
- ✅ Successful redirect to dashboard after login
- ✅ Session management with NextAuth
- ✅ Protected dashboard routes
- ✅ Local JSON-based user storage

## Test Credentials
**Admin Account:**
- Username: `admin` (or email: `tone.dubai@icloud.com`)
- Password: `Admin@2025!`

**Test Account:**
- Username: `testuser` (or email: `test@test.com`)
