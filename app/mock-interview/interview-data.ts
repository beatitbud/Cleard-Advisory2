      question: "A user reports their computer won't turn on at all. Walk me through your troubleshooting steps from the most basic to advanced.",
      answer: "I'd start with the fundamentals: verify the power cable is securely connected to both the computer and outlet, test the outlet with another device, check if the power strip is turned on and functioning. Next, I'd look for LED indicators on the motherboard or power supply, listen for fan noise or beep codes, and try a different power cable. If still no response, I'd reseat the RAM and remove all unnecessary peripherals. For desktop systems, I'd test with a known good power supply. If these fail, it could indicate motherboard or CPU failure requiring component replacement. Throughout this process, I'd document each step and finding in the ticket system."

    {
      question: "Explain the boot process of a Windows computer and where issues commonly occur.",
      answer: "The boot process begins with POST (Power-On Self Test) where BIOS/UEFI checks hardware components. Then it locates the boot device and loads the bootloader (Windows Boot Manager), which reads the BCD (Boot Configuration Data) and loads winload.exe. This starts the kernel, loads drivers, and initializes Windows services before presenting the login screen. Common failure points include: POST failures (hardware issues, beep codes), boot device not found (failed hard drive, incorrect boot order), corrupted bootloader (fixable with bootrec commands), BCD corruption (repairable with bcdedit), driver conflicts causing blue screens during loading, and corrupted system files preventing Windows from starting. Each stage has specific troubleshooting approaches."

    {
      question: "A user's laptop is overheating and shutting down randomly. What are your diagnostic steps and potential solutions?",
      answer: "First, I'd check for obvious airflow obstructions and ensure vents aren't blocked by dust or debris. I'd use compressed air to clean the vents and fan exhausts carefully. Then I'd monitor temperatures using HWMonitor or Core Temp to identify if CPU or GPU is overheating. I'd check Task Manager for processes consuming high CPU, potentially indicating malware or runaway processes. Next steps include: updating BIOS and chipset drivers, checking power settings aren't set to maximum performance unnecessarily, verifying the laptop is on a hard, flat surface for proper ventilation, and potentially replacing thermal paste if the laptop is older. If under warranty, I'd coordinate hardware service for internal cleaning or fan replacement."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you assist a user experiencing intermittent wireless connectivity issues?",
      answer: "I'd start by gathering information: frequency of disconnections, specific times or locations, and whether other devices have issues. First, I'd update the wireless adapter driver and reset TCP/IP stack using netsh commands. I'd check for interference by changing the router channel (especially from crowded 2.4GHz channels), ensure power saving isn't disabled for the wireless adapter, and verify Windows isn't turning off the device to save power. I'd also check signal strength and consider relocating closer to the access point or adding a repeater. Other steps include: checking for VPN software conflicts, disabling IPv6 if not needed, reviewing event logs for specific errors, and potentially replacing the wireless card if hardware failure is suspected. Documentation of when issues occur helps identify patterns."
    },
    {
      question: "Describe your process for removing malware from an infected system while preserving user data.",
      answer: "First, I'd isolate the system from the network to prevent spread. I'd boot into Safe Mode with Networking to limit malware activity. My removal process includes: running Windows Defender Offline scan, using Malwarebytes in Safe Mode, checking with additional tools like ESET Online Scanner or Hitman Pro for second opinions. I'd review startup items, scheduled tasks, and browser extensions for suspicious entries. Important steps include: checking hosts file for redirects, clearing temporary files and browser caches, resetting browser settings to defaults, and verifying system files with SFC and DISM. After cleaning, I'd ensure Windows and antivirus are fully updated, create a restore point, and educate the user on safe browsing practices. If infection is severe, I'd backup user data and perform a clean Windows installation."
    },
    {
      question: "A printer is installed but won't print. What's your systematic approach to resolve this?",
      answer: "I'd start with basic connectivity: verify the printer is powered on, check USB or network cable connections, and confirm the printer shows as online in Devices and Printers. Next, I'd clear the print spooler by stopping the service, deleting files from C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\PRINTERS, and restarting the service. I'd then check for driver issues by removing and reinstalling the printer with the latest drivers from the manufacturer. For network printers, I'd verify IP addressing and ping the printer, check firewall rules aren't blocking printing ports, and ensure the user has permissions to the print queue. Additional steps include: printing a test page directly from the printer, checking for paper jams or low ink/toner warnings, and verifying the correct printer is set as default. For persistent issues, I might recreate the user's Windows profile."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you approach data backup and recovery for a small business environment?",
      answer: "I'd implement a 3-2-1 backup strategy: three copies of data, on two different media types, with one copy offsite. For small businesses, I'd recommend: automated daily backups using Windows Server Backup or third-party software like Veeam, local backups to a NAS device for quick recovery, and cloud backups to services like Azure or AWS for disaster recovery. Important considerations include: encrypting sensitive data, testing restore procedures monthly, documenting what data needs backing up and retention periods, implementing versioning to protect against ransomware, and ensuring backups include system state for full server recovery. I'd create a disaster recovery plan with RTO/RPO objectives, maintain backup logs, and train staff on basic recovery procedures. Regular verification ensures backups are valid when needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain how you would secure a Windows workstation for a new employee in a corporate environment.",
      answer: "I'd start with a clean Windows installation from our standard image, ensuring all patches are current. Security measures include: enabling BitLocker full-disk encryption, configuring Windows Firewall with appropriate rules, installing enterprise antivirus with real-time protection, enabling Windows Defender features like SmartScreen and Exploit Guard. Account security involves: creating a standard user account (not admin), enforcing strong password policy via Group Policy, enabling account lockout after failed attempts, and configuring MFA where supported. Additional hardening includes: disabling unnecessary services and features, configuring UAC to always prompt, restricting software installation to approved applications, enabling audit logging for security events, and configuring automatic updates. I'd also brief the user on security best practices including phishing awareness and clean desk policy."
    },
    {
      question: "A department is experiencing slow network performance. How would you diagnose and resolve this issue?",
      answer: "I'd begin by defining 'slow' - whether it's internet access, file transfers, or specific applications. Initial diagnostics include: running speed tests from affected computers, checking switch port statistics for errors or high utilization, using netstat to identify unusual connections, and monitoring bandwidth usage by device. I'd verify physical infrastructure: checking for damaged cables, ensuring gigabit negotiation on connections, and confirming switches aren't overloaded. Network analysis involves: using Wireshark to identify broadcast storms or excessive traffic, checking for malware performing network scans, verifying DHCP isn't exhausted, and ensuring DNS responses are timely. Solutions might include: implementing VLANs to segment traffic, enabling QoS for critical applications, updating switch firmware, replacing aging network equipment, or increasing internet bandwidth. Documentation helps identify patterns and justify infrastructure upgrades."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you plan and execute a Windows 10 to Windows 11 migration for 50 users?",
      answer: "I'd start with a comprehensive assessment: running PC Health Check on all machines to verify TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot compatibility, identifying incompatible hardware needing replacement, and testing all business-critical applications for Windows 11 compatibility. Planning phase includes: creating a phased rollout schedule starting with IT and power users, preparing a standard Windows 11 image with all required software, documenting known issues and workarounds, and creating user training materials for UI changes. Execution involves: backing up user data before migration, using SCCM or Intune for deployment, scheduling migrations during off-hours to minimize disruption, and providing hands-on support during the first week. Post-migration: monitoring for issues via help desk tickets, gathering user feedback for process improvement, updating documentation and knowledge base, and planning hardware refresh for incompatible devices. Success requires clear communication and setting realistic expectations."
    },
    {
      question: "A user reports their computer displays a 'No boot device found' error. What are the potential causes and how would you troubleshoot this systematically?",
      answer: "This error indicates the BIOS/UEFI cannot find a bootable operating system. I'd start by checking the boot order in BIOS settings to ensure the correct drive is prioritized. Common causes include: loose SATA/M.2 connections (reseat cables and drives), failed hard drive (run diagnostics using manufacturer tools), corrupted boot sector (use Windows Recovery to run bootrec /fixboot and /fixmbr), incorrect BIOS settings (verify AHCI/RAID mode matches OS installation), or disabled boot device (check if drive appears in BIOS). For deeper issues, I'd boot from Windows installation media to access recovery tools, run chkdsk /f to check for disk errors, and use diskpart to verify partition structure. If the drive isn't detected in BIOS at all, it likely indicates hardware failure requiring replacement. I'd also check for recent hardware changes that might have affected boot configuration."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the differences between RAM types (DDR3, DDR4, DDR5) and how to identify compatibility issues when upgrading memory.",
      answer: "DDR generations differ in speed, voltage, and physical design. DDR3 operates at 1.5V with speeds from 800-2133MHz, DDR4 at 1.2V with 2133-3200MHz standard speeds, and DDR5 at 1.1V starting at 4800MHz. Each has different pin counts (DDR3: 240, DDR4/DDR5: 288) and notch positions preventing incorrect installation. To identify compatibility, I'd check: motherboard specifications for supported RAM type and maximum capacity, CPU memory controller limitations, number of available slots and maximum per-slot capacity, and whether dual-channel configuration is required. Tools like CPU-Z show current memory configuration, while the motherboard manual lists qualified vendor lists (QVL). Common issues include: mixing different speeds (system runs at slowest speed), incompatible timings causing instability, and exceeding chipset limitations. Always match existing RAM specifications when adding modules, and run memory diagnostics after installation to verify stability."

    {
      question: "A laser printer is producing pages with vertical lines running down the entire length. What components would you check and in what order?",
      answer: "Vertical lines on laser printer output typically indicate issues with the imaging system. I'd troubleshoot in this order: First, print a cleaning page to remove toner buildup. If lines persist, I'd inspect the toner cartridge for damage or leaks - often scratches on the drum surface cause consistent lines. Next, I'd check the transfer roller for toner accumulation or damage, cleaning it with approved methods. The fuser assembly could have damage or debris causing lines during the heating process. For persistent issues, I'd examine the laser scanner unit for dust on mirrors or lens requiring careful cleaning. The charge roller (if separate from cartridge) might have damage or contamination. I'd also verify proper paper type settings as incorrect settings affect toner application. Documentation should include: line positions, whether lines appear on all print jobs, and if they're the same color as the print or different. Most issues resolve with cartridge replacement, but persistent problems indicate printer mechanism issues."
    },
    {
      question: "Describe proper ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) procedures when working on computer components and explain why each step is important.",
      answer: "ESD protection is critical as static discharge can damage sensitive components even without visible signs. Proper procedures include: Using an anti-static wrist strap connected to a grounded surface - this equalizes electrical potential between you and components. Working on anti-static mats provides a controlled discharge path for static buildup. Before handling components, touch a grounded metal surface to discharge static. Store components in anti-static bags which have a conductive outer layer creating a Faraday cage effect. Keep humidity between 40-60% as dry air increases static buildup. Remove components by edges, avoiding contact with pins or circuits. Never place components on carpeted or plastic surfaces which generate static. Power down and unplug systems before work, but keep power supplies connected to maintain ground reference. Avoid wearing static-generating clothing like wool or synthetic materials. These precautions matter because ESD damage can be immediate (complete failure) or latent (degraded performance over time), and components like RAM, CPUs, and expansion cards are particularly vulnerable."

    {
      question: "A user cannot access a network share but can browse the internet. Walk through your troubleshooting process including specific commands and tools.",
      answer: "Since internet works, basic connectivity is functioning. I'd start by pinging the file server by both IP address and hostname to test basic connectivity and name resolution. If ping by IP works but hostname fails, it's a DNS issue - check with nslookup and ipconfig /all for DNS settings. Next, I'd verify SMB connectivity using 'net view \\\\servername' to list available shares. Common issues include: Windows Firewall blocking SMB ports (445, 139) - check Windows Defender Firewall rules. Credential problems - use 'net use * /delete' to clear cached credentials, then remap with correct username. Permission issues - verify user account has share and NTFS permissions on the server. Time synchronization - SMB requires synchronized clocks, check with w32tm /query /status. Network discovery disabled - ensure network profile is Private/Domain, not Public. I'd also check Event Viewer for specific error codes, verify the share exists and server service is running, and test with a different user account to isolate profile issues. Document successful access methods for future reference."

      question: "Explain the CI/CD pipeline you would implement for a microservices application with security clearance requirements.",
      answer: "I'd implement a secure CI/CD pipeline using GitLab or Jenkins with security scanning at each stage. The pipeline would include: Source control with branch protection and signed commits, automated unit and integration testing with minimum 80% coverage, SAST scanning using SonarQube for code vulnerabilities, container scanning with Trivy or Twistlock for image vulnerabilities, DAST testing in staging environment, and automated deployment to Kubernetes with Helm charts. For cleared environments, I'd ensure all artifacts are stored in private registries, implement role-based access control, maintain audit logs for compliance, use encrypted secrets management (HashiCorp Vault), and separate CI/CD infrastructure from production. The pipeline would enforce security gates that block deployment if vulnerabilities exceed thresholds."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you implement Infrastructure as Code for a classified environment using Terraform?",
      answer: "For classified environments, I'd implement Terraform with strict security controls. First, I'd use Terraform Enterprise or Cloud with private module registry to maintain approved modules. State files would be encrypted and stored in S3 with versioning and access logging. I'd implement: Remote state locking to prevent concurrent modifications, separate state files per environment with different access controls, use of data sources instead of hardcoded values, variables for all environment-specific configurations, and mandatory tagging for resource tracking. Security measures include: running Terraform through bastion hosts only, using assume role for AWS access, implementing approval workflows for production changes, regular state file backups, and drift detection to identify manual changes. All Terraform code would undergo security review before merge."
    },
    {
      question: "Describe your approach to implementing monitoring and alerting for a distributed system.",
      answer: "I'd implement comprehensive monitoring using the Prometheus/Grafana stack with ELK for log aggregation. For metrics collection: Deploy Prometheus with service discovery for dynamic environments, use exporters for system metrics (node_exporter) and application metrics, implement custom metrics for business KPIs, and set up Alertmanager with PagerDuty integration. For logging: Centralize logs using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, implement structured logging with correlation IDs, set retention policies based on compliance requirements, and create dashboards for common troubleshooting scenarios. Alerting strategy includes: defining SLIs/SLOs for critical services, implementing progressive alerting (warning then critical), using runbooks linked to each alert, and regular alert tuning to reduce noise. I'd also implement distributed tracing with Jaeger for microservices debugging."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle secrets management in a DevOps environment?",
      answer: "I implement a zero-trust approach to secrets management using HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. Key practices include: Never storing secrets in code or configuration files, using dynamic secrets that expire and rotate automatically, implementing least-privilege access with time-limited tokens, and auditing all secret access. In CI/CD pipelines, I use service accounts with minimal permissions, inject secrets at runtime (not build time), and never log sensitive values. For Kubernetes, I'd use Sealed Secrets or external-secrets operator to sync from Vault. Implementation includes: encryption in transit and at rest, separate secrets per environment, automated rotation policies, break-glass procedures for emergencies, and regular audits of secret usage. All secret access is logged for compliance and investigation purposes."
    },

Implementation details: Use AWS regions or availability zones for geographic redundancy, implement database replication (synchronous for critical data), automate failover using Route53 health checks, maintain hot standby environments for critical services, and regular backup testing with restoration drills. Testing includes: quarterly full DR exercises, monthly backup restoration tests, automated testing of failover mechanisms, and post-mortem analysis for continuous improvement. Documentation covers escalation procedures, communication plans, and step-by-step recovery processes."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you optimize container images for production deployment?",
      answer: "I optimize container images focusing on security, size, and performance. Start with minimal base images like Alpine or distroless to reduce attack surface. Multi-stage builds separate build dependencies from runtime, keeping final images small. Security measures include: running as non-root user, removing unnecessary packages and tools, scanning for vulnerabilities before deployment, and signing images with Notary/Cosign. Optimization techniques: use specific version tags (never 'latest'), leverage build cache effectively, combine RUN commands to reduce layers, clean package manager cache in same layer, and use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files. For production: implement health checks in Dockerfile, use read-only root filesystem where possible, set resource limits, and maintain SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for compliance. Regular reviews ensure images stay updated and secure."
    },
    {
      question: "Describe your approach to implementing blue-green deployments in Kubernetes.",
      answer: "I implement blue-green deployments using Kubernetes services and ingress controllers. The approach involves maintaining two identical environments (blue=current, green=new). Implementation steps: Deploy new version to green environment with separate deployment/service, run smoke tests and validation against green, use ingress controller or service selector to switch traffic, monitor metrics and error rates post-switch, and keep blue environment for quick rollback. Advanced features include: using Flagger or Argo Rollouts for automation, implementing canary deployments for gradual rollout, setting up automated rollback triggers based on metrics, and using service mesh (Istio) for traffic management. Critical considerations: database migration compatibility, session persistence during switch, cache warming for green environment, and maintaining separate config maps/secrets. Post-deployment includes monitoring, gradual blue environment teardown, and documentation updates."

Technical implementations: SAST/DAST scanning in CI/CD pipeline, dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities, container and infrastructure scanning, secrets scanning to prevent leaks, and compliance as code for policy enforcement. Process improvements: security champions in each team, regular threat modeling sessions, blameless security incident reviews, and automated audit trail generation. For cleared environments: implement FedRAMP/NIST controls, maintain system security plans (SSP), conduct regular security assessments, and ensure continuous monitoring. All changes undergo security review with documented approvals."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain your strategy for managing Kubernetes clusters at scale.",
      answer: "Managing Kubernetes at scale requires automation, standardization, and observability. I use GitOps with Flux or ArgoCD for declarative cluster management. Key practices: Cluster provisioning using Terraform or Cluster API, standardized cluster configurations with kustomize, automated certificate rotation and upgrades, and multi-tenancy with namespace isolation. Operational excellence includes: implementing pod security policies/standards, resource quotas and limit ranges per namespace, network policies for microsegmentation, and RBAC with least-privilege principle. Monitoring involves: cluster autoscaling based on metrics, node health monitoring and automatic remediation, cost optimization with spot instances where appropriate, and centralized logging/monitoring across clusters. Day-2 operations: automated backup of etcd and persistent volumes, regular security patching schedule, capacity planning based on growth trends, and disaster recovery testing."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you troubleshoot a memory leak in a containerized application?",
      answer: "I'd systematically identify and resolve memory leaks using monitoring and profiling tools. Initial detection through metrics: Monitor container memory usage over time in Prometheus/Grafana, set up alerts for abnormal memory growth patterns, correlate with application metrics and request rates, and check for restart patterns due to OOM kills. Diagnostic steps: Enable memory profiling in the application (pprof for Go, heap dumps for Java), use kubectl top to view real-time resource usage, analyze container logs for error patterns, and review recent code changes or deployments. Deep analysis: Capture heap dumps at intervals for comparison, use profiling tools to identify growing objects, check for unclosed connections or streams, and review garbage collection logs. Resolution includes: implementing proper resource cleanup, setting appropriate memory limits, using horizontal pod autoscaling, and adding memory leak detection to CI/CD pipeline. Document findings and add monitoring for recurrence."
    },
    {
      question: "Describe your approach to implementing zero-downtime database migrations.",
      answer: "Zero-downtime migrations require careful planning and backwards compatibility. My approach uses expand-contract pattern: First expand (add new schema elements maintaining compatibility), migrate data while both schemas work, then contract (remove old schema). Implementation steps: Use migration tools like Flyway or Liquibase with version control, test migrations thoroughly in staging environment, implement feature flags for application changes, and ensure rollback capability for each step. For complex changes: break into smaller backwards-compatible steps, use database triggers for data synchronization, implement dual-write pattern during transition, and monitor query performance throughout. Critical practices: avoid locking DDL operations, use online schema change tools for large tables, maintain database backups before migration, and coordinate with application deployments. Post-migration: verify data integrity, update documentation, and remove temporary compatibility code."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you implement cost optimization in cloud environments while maintaining performance?",
      answer: "Cost optimization requires continuous monitoring and right-sizing without impacting performance. I implement: automated resource tagging for cost allocation, regular analysis using AWS Cost Explorer or similar, rightsizing recommendations based on actual usage, and reserved instances or savings plans for predictable workloads. Technical optimizations: implement auto-scaling with appropriate thresholds, use spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads, schedule non-production resources to stop after hours, and optimize storage classes based on access patterns. Architecture decisions: use caching to reduce compute needs, implement CDN for static content delivery, choose appropriate instance families for workloads, and consolidate underutilized resources. Monitoring includes: set up budget alerts and anomaly detection, regular cost review meetings with stakeholders, showback/chargeback to teams, and track cost per transaction/user metrics. Balance cost with performance SLAs ensuring optimization doesn't impact user experience."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain your incident response process for production outages.",
      answer: "I follow a structured incident response process focused on rapid resolution and learning. Initial response: automated alerting triggers on-call engineer, assess severity and impact scope, establish incident command structure, and open communication channels (Slack, bridge call). During incident: designate incident commander to coordinate response, assign roles (technical lead, communications, scribe), focus on mitigation over root cause initially, and communicate status updates regularly. Resolution steps: implement temporary fixes if needed, verify system restoration through monitoring, document timeline and actions taken, and notify stakeholders of resolution. Post-incident: conduct blameless post-mortem within 48 hours, identify root cause and contributing factors, create action items to prevent recurrence, and share learnings across organization. Continuous improvement: maintain runbooks for common issues, practice incident response with drills, automate detection and remediation where possible, and track MTTR metrics."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you design a logging architecture for a microservices platform?",
      answer: "I'd design a centralized logging architecture that scales with microservices growth. Core components: structured JSON logging from all services, unique correlation IDs across service calls, log aggregation using Fluentd or Logstash, and storage in Elasticsearch with retention policies. Implementation details: standardize log formats across services, include contextual metadata (service, version, environment), implement log sampling for high-volume services, and use index lifecycle management for cost control. Security considerations: encrypt logs in transit and at rest, implement RBAC for log access, redact sensitive data before logging, and maintain audit logs for compliance. Operational features: create service-specific dashboards in Kibana, implement alerting on error patterns, use machine learning for anomaly detection, and enable distributed tracing integration. Best practices: avoid logging sensitive information, implement log rotation at source, monitor logging infrastructure performance, and provide self-service log access to developers."
    },
    {
      question: "Describe your approach to implementing canary deployments with automatic rollback.",
      answer: "I implement canary deployments using progressive delivery tools like Flagger or Argo Rollouts. Strategy involves: deploying new version alongside current (canary), routing small percentage of traffic initially, monitoring key metrics for degradation, and automatically promoting or rolling back based on analysis. Technical implementation: use Kubernetes deployments with multiple replicas, implement weighted traffic routing via service mesh or ingress, define success criteria (error rate, latency, custom metrics), and set up automated analysis using Prometheus metrics. Progressive stages: start with 5% traffic to canary, increase to 25%, 50% if metrics are healthy, monitor for sufficient time at each stage, and complete rollout or rollback automatically. Rollback triggers: error rate exceeds threshold, latency increases significantly, custom business metrics degrade, or manual intervention required. Post-deployment: analyze canary metrics for improvements, document any issues encountered, and refine thresholds based on experience."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you secure container registries and ensure supply chain security?",
      answer: "Container registry security is critical for supply chain protection. I implement: private registries with authentication required, vulnerability scanning on push using Trivy/Clair, image signing with Cosign or Notary, and SBOM generation for all images. Access controls: RBAC with minimal permissions, separate registries per environment, audit logging for all operations, and regular access reviews. Security policies: enforce scanning before production use, block images with critical vulnerabilities, require signed images in production, and implement retention policies. Supply chain protection: verify base image sources, pin specific versions (no latest tags), regularly update base images, and scan for license compliance. Operational security: use image promotion between environments, implement break-glass procedures, monitor for unauthorized access, and integrate with SIEM systems. Regular security assessments ensure continued protection of the container supply chain."

Key components include: log collection agents on all systems with encrypted transport, normalized log formats for correlation, and real-time analysis with custom detection rules. Implementation focuses on: privileged user activity monitoring, baseline normal behavior patterns, correlation rules for attack patterns, and automated incident creation. For classified networks: implement data loss prevention monitoring, cross-domain transfer logging, clearance verification events, and system high-water mark tracking. Integration includes: ticketing systems for incident response, threat intelligence feeds (classified sources), automated containment responses, and compliance reporting dashboards. Regular tuning reduces false positives while maintaining detection capability."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you respond to a suspected data exfiltration attempt in a secure environment?",
      answer: "Data exfiltration response requires immediate containment and investigation. Initial actions: isolate affected systems from network, preserve evidence (memory dumps, logs), notify security operations center and management, and activate incident response team. Investigation steps: analyze network traffic for unusual patterns, review endpoint logs for suspicious processes, check removable media usage logs, examine email and web proxy logs for large transfers, and correlate user activity with normal patterns. Containment measures: block suspected communication channels, disable compromised accounts, implement egress filtering rules, and increase monitoring on similar systems. For classified environments: notify FSO and appropriate authorities, document all actions for investigation, preserve chain of custody for evidence, and coordinate with counterintelligence if needed. Post-incident: conduct thorough forensic analysis, identify root cause and attack vector, implement additional controls, and update incident response procedures."

      question: "How do you conduct vulnerability assessments while maintaining operational security?",
      answer: "Vulnerability assessments must balance thoroughness with operational impact. Planning phase: coordinate with system owners for maintenance windows, define scope excluding critical production times, obtain written authorization before testing, and prepare rollback plans for any issues. Assessment methodology: start with passive reconnaissance and asset discovery, use authenticated scans for comprehensive results, prioritize findings by CVSS and exploitability, and validate findings to eliminate false positives. For classified systems: use approved scanning tools only, ensure scanners are at appropriate classification, implement compensating controls during assessment, and never use external scanning services. Operational considerations: rate-limit scans to prevent DoS, monitor system performance during scans, coordinate with SOC to prevent false alerts, and immediately report critical findings. Deliverables include: executive summary with risk ratings, technical details for remediation teams, compliance mapping (NIST, DISA STIGs), and remediation roadmap with timelines."
