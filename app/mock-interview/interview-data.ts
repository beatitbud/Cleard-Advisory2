    // EASY QUESTIONS (1-5) - Basic troubleshooting and procedures
    {
      question: "A user forgot their password and needs to access their computer. What steps do you take to help them?",
      answer: "I'd first verify the user's identity by asking security questions or checking their employee ID. Then I'd access our password reset system: log into Active Directory or our identity management portal, locate the user's account, and select the password reset option. I'd generate a temporary password following company policy (complex, expires on first use), provide it to the user securely (in person or via verified phone), and instruct them to change it immediately upon login. I'd also remind them of password requirements: minimum 8 characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Document the reset in the ticket system with date, time, and verification method used. Finally, offer to show them how to use the self-service password reset portal for future issues."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you properly document a support ticket from start to resolution?",
      answer: "Good documentation starts with the initial contact. I'd record: user's name and contact information, date and time of request, brief problem description, and priority level. During troubleshooting, I'd document each step taken and its result, any error messages verbatim, and time spent on each action. For the resolution, I'd note what fixed the issue, any parts or software used, and total time to resolve. I'd also include follow-up actions needed, knowledge base articles referenced, and whether this is a recurring issue. Before closing, I'd ensure the ticket has clear problem/solution summary for future reference, verify user confirms issue is resolved, and categorize properly for reporting. This helps build our knowledge base and track common issues."
    },
    {
      question: "A new employee needs their workstation set up. Walk through the process.",
      answer: "I'd start by checking the new hire ticket for specifications: username, department, required software, and start date. First, prepare the hardware: unbox and inspect computer for damage, connect monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and plug into power and network. Initial setup includes: power on and enter BIOS to verify hardware, boot from network or USB to image machine, and join to domain with computer name per naming convention. User configuration: create local profile with their domain account, install department-specific software (Office, specialized apps), and configure email in Outlook. Set up peripherals: install printer drivers and map network printers, test scanner or other devices, and verify network drive mappings. Final checks: test all applications launch properly, verify internet and intranet access, ensure security software is updated, and create desktop shortcuts for common resources. Document setup completion and provide new employee with quick reference guide and IT contact information."
    },
    {
      question: "A user says their computer is running very slowly. What are your first steps to help them?",
      answer: "I'd start with quick checks that often solve the issue. First, check Task Manager: press Ctrl+Shift+Esc, look at CPU and memory usage percentages, identify any programs using high resources, and note if disk usage is at 100%. Basic fixes to try: restart the computer if it's been on for days, close unnecessary browser tabs and programs, check if Windows updates are downloading in background, and see if antivirus is running a scan. Check startup programs: open Task Manager's Startup tab, disable unnecessary programs set to auto-start, especially ones marked 'High' impact. Clear temporary files: run Disk Cleanup utility, empty Recycle Bin, clear browser cache and cookies. If still slow: check hard drive health in Event Viewer, verify at least 15% free disk space, run Windows Memory Diagnostic for RAM issues, and schedule full antivirus scan after hours. Document what improved performance for future reference."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you help a user connect to a network printer?",
      answer: "I'd first gather information: printer name or IP address, whether it's a network or shared printer, and if they've used it before. For Windows setup: open Settings > Devices > Printers & scanners, click 'Add a printer or scanner', wait for automatic detection, and if found, select and click 'Add device'. If not auto-detected: click 'The printer that I want isn't listed', choose 'Add printer using TCP/IP address', enter the printer's IP address, and Windows will install drivers automatically. For shared printers: choose 'Select a shared printer by name', enter path like \\servername\printername, or browse the network to find it. Test the connection: print a test page, verify it printed correctly, and set as default if it's their main printer. Common issues: ensure user has permissions to print, check if printer driver needs updating, verify printer is online and not paused, and confirm they're on the same network segment. Document printer name and connection method in ticket."
    },
    // MEDIUM QUESTIONS (6-10) - More technical but still foundational
    {
      question: "A user can't access their email in Outlook. How do you troubleshoot this?",
      answer: "I'd start by identifying the specific error: is Outlook not opening, not connecting, or showing password prompts? For connection issues: verify internet connectivity with other websites, check if webmail works (confirms account is active), and look for any error messages. In Outlook, check account settings: File > Account Settings, verify server names are correct, confirm username is full email address, and test account settings button. Common fixes: repair Outlook profile (Control Panel > Mail), recreate Outlook profile if corrupted, clear cached credentials in Credential Manager, and run Outlook in Safe Mode (outlook.exe /safe). Check authentication: ensure password is correct, look for two-factor authentication requirements, and verify account isn't locked. For Exchange users: confirm autodiscover is working, check connection status (Ctrl+right-click Outlook icon), and verify they're on corporate network or VPN. If resolved, document the fix and educate user on signs to watch for. Consider setting up mobile email as backup access method."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you troubleshoot a computer that keeps getting Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) errors?",
      answer: "I'd first document the error code and message from the blue screen (like MEMORY_MANAGEMENT or DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL). Check Event Viewer: Windows Logs > System for critical errors, look for patterns before crashes, and note any driver or hardware warnings. Initial software checks: boot into Safe Mode to see if issue persists, uninstall recently installed programs or updates, update all drivers especially graphics and chipset, and run System File Checker (sfc /scannow). Hardware diagnostics: run Windows Memory Diagnostic for RAM issues, check hard drive with chkdsk /f /r, monitor temperatures for overheating, and reseat RAM and expansion cards. Use BlueScreenView tool to analyze dump files and identify the failing driver or component. If specific driver identified: roll back or update that driver, check manufacturer for known issues, and consider removing related hardware temporarily. For persistent issues: perform clean boot to isolate software conflicts, consider Windows Reset keeping files, or backup and clean install as last resort. Document pattern of crashes and solutions tried for escalation if needed."
    },
    {
      question: "A department printer is printing with streaks and smudges. What's your troubleshooting approach?",
      answer: "I'd first identify the printer type (laser or inkjet) as solutions differ. For laser printers: print a cleaning page from printer settings, check toner levels (low toner can cause streaking), and inspect toner cartridge for leaks or damage. Remove and gently rock toner cartridge to redistribute toner, clean the printer's corona wire if accessible, and check for paper debris inside printer. For inkjet printers: run print head cleaning utility (may need 2-3 cycles), check ink levels in all cartridges, and align print heads using printer utility. For both types: ensure using correct paper type (photo, plain, etc.), verify paper isn't damp or damaged, and clean paper path with lint-free cloth. If hardware issues suspected: check if under warranty for service, look for worn pickup rollers (causing paper feed issues), and consider replacing imaging drum (laser) or print heads (inkjet). Test with different paper and print quality settings. Document which solutions work for common reference, and train users on basic maintenance like cleaning cycles. Consider scheduling regular preventive maintenance."
    },
    {
      question: "Walk me through setting up a VPN connection for a remote worker.",
      answer: "I'd first verify the user has VPN credentials: username, password, and VPN server address, any required certificates or tokens, and appropriate permissions in Active Directory. For Windows built-in VPN: go to Settings > Network & Internet > VPN, click 'Add VPN connection', select Windows (built-in) as provider, and enter connection name for reference. Configure connection: input server address (IP or hostname), select VPN type (usually automatic or L2TP/IPSec), enter sign-in info (username/password), and save the configuration. For corporate VPN client: download installer from company portal, run as administrator, and enter server address when prompted. Install any required certificates, configure any specific settings (split tunneling, DNS), and test connection with credentials. Verify connectivity: confirm VPN connects successfully, test access to internal resources, verify mapped drives appear, and ensure corporate applications work. Troubleshooting tips: check firewall isn't blocking VPN ports, verify user is on reliable internet, confirm credentials are correct and not expired, and try different internet connection if failing. Document VPN server address and support contact for user reference."
    },
    {
      question: "A user reports their files are missing from their desktop. How do you help recover them?",
      answer: "I'd first stay calm and reassure the user that files can often be recovered. Check common scenarios: see if files were accidentally moved (search by filename), check Recycle Bin for deleted items, and verify they're logged into correct user profile. Look in common locations: check Documents folder (desktop items sometimes redirect there), look in C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop, verify if OneDrive moved them to cloud, and check if Windows Update created Windows.old folder. Use Windows search: search for specific filenames or file types, look for *.docx, *.xlsx for Office files, and check recent documents in applications. File recovery options: check if Previous Versions available (right-click > Properties), use File History if enabled, and look for backup software running. If using OneDrive/cloud storage: check online portal for files, look in cloud recycle bin, and verify sync is working properly. For deleted files: immediately stop using computer to prevent overwriting, consider recovery software like Recuva, and check if IT has network backups available. Document what was recovered and educate about backup importance. Set up automatic backup solution to prevent future loss."
    },
    // HARDER QUESTIONS (11-15) - More complex scenarios and deeper knowledge
    {
      question: "How do you troubleshoot DNS resolution issues on a Windows machine?",
      answer: "I'd start with basic DNS diagnostics using nslookup to test name resolution: query a known domain like google.com, check if it returns the correct IP, and try using different DNS servers (8.8.8.8). Check current DNS configuration: run ipconfig /all to see assigned DNS servers, verify they're correct for the network, and ensure no typos in server addresses. Clear DNS cache: run ipconfig /flushdns as administrator, restart DNS Client service, and clear browser DNS cache too. Test with IP addresses: ping website by IP (bypasses DNS), if IP works but name doesn't, confirms DNS issue, and check hosts file for incorrect entries. Advanced troubleshooting: check if NXDOMAIN or timeout errors, verify DNS suffix search list is correct, test if forwarders working on DNS server, and use Wireshark to capture DNS queries/responses. Network-level checks: verify firewall allows port 53 (UDP/TCP), check if ISP having DNS issues, test if DNSSEC validation failing, and try alternative DNS (Cloudflare: 1.1.1.1). For domain-joined computers: verify can reach domain controllers, check if using correct internal DNS, and test if conditional forwarders working. Document which DNS servers work for future reference."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain how Group Policy works and how you'd troubleshoot GPO issues.",
      answer: "Group Policy applies settings hierarchically from domain controllers to computers and users. The order is: Local, Site, Domain, then Organizational Unit (OU) policies, with later policies overriding earlier ones. Policies refresh every 90 minutes for workstations (plus random 0-30 minute offset), immediately with gpupdate /force command, and always at computer startup and user logon. To troubleshoot GPO issues, I'd run gpresult /r to see applied policies, use gpresult /h report.html for detailed HTML report, and check if computer/user in correct OU. Verify policy application: run rsop.msc for Resultant Set of Policy, check Event Viewer > Applications and Services > Microsoft > Windows > GroupPolicy, and use gpupdate /force to manually refresh. Common issues: check if policy is linked and enabled, verify security filtering includes user/computer, ensure no WMI filters blocking application, and check for policy conflicts or denials. Test policy inheritance: look for 'Block Inheritance' on OUs, check for 'Enforced' policies overriding blocks, and verify policy precedence order. DNS and replication: ensure client can reach domain controllers, check if policies replicated between DCs, and verify SYSVOL share accessible. Document which policies should apply and create test OUs for policy testing."
    },
    {
      question: "A critical application server is performing poorly. How do you diagnose and resolve performance issues?",
      answer: "I'd start with Windows Performance Monitor to establish baseline metrics: CPU utilization (average and peaks), memory usage and page file activity, disk I/O and queue length, and network throughput and errors. Check Task Manager and Resource Monitor: identify top processes by CPU/memory, look for handle or thread leaks, monitor disk activity by process, and check network connections. Review Event Logs: look for application errors or warnings, check System log for hardware issues, and review application-specific logs. Server-specific checks: verify adequate RAM (check if paging excessively), ensure disk space >15% free on all drives, check if antivirus scanning during business hours, and verify scheduled tasks not conflicting. Database considerations: check for long-running queries, verify maintenance plans running (index rebuilds), monitor transaction log growth, and check for blocking/deadlocks. Network analysis: test latency to database/services, verify bandwidth utilization, check for packet loss or errors, and ensure NIC settings optimal (offloading, RSS). Performance tuning: adjust application pool settings (IIS), modify SQL memory allocation if needed, consider adding RAM or CPU resources, and implement caching where appropriate. Create performance baseline for comparison and document all changes made."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you implement and manage BitLocker encryption across multiple workstations?",
      answer: "I'd implement BitLocker through Group Policy for centralized management. First, verify requirements: TPM 1.2 or 2.0 chip present (preferred), UEFI firmware with Secure Boot, and Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise. Configure Group Policy: Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > BitLocker, set encryption method (AES 256-bit recommended), configure TPM startup PIN requirements, and enable recovery key backup to AD. Deployment process: push policy to target computers via GPO, use manage-bde or PowerShell for remote enabling, and monitor encryption status via MBAM or scripts. Recovery key management: ensure keys backed up to Active Directory, document recovery key retrieval process, test recovery procedures regularly, and maintain secure offline backup. Configure protectors: TPM only for user convenience, TPM + PIN for higher security, and consider TPM + PIN + USB key for sensitive systems. Monitor compliance: use PowerShell scripts to check encryption status, create reports for management, and alert on non-compliant systems. Common issues: suspended BitLocker after updates (resume required), recovery mode after hardware changes, and TPM errors requiring reset. Document BitLocker policies and train helpdesk on recovery procedures. Consider Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) for enterprise management."
    },
    {
      question: "Describe how you would plan and execute a Windows 10 to Windows 11 migration for 50 workstations.",
      answer: "I'd start with compatibility assessment using PC Health Check on all machines: verify TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot support, check for 4GB RAM and 64GB storage minimum, identify incompatible hardware needing replacement, and test all business-critical applications. Create deployment plan: use phased approach (IT first, then pilot group, then departments), schedule around business operations, and plan for 2-3 hours per machine. Prepare deployment infrastructure: create Windows 11 image with standard software, use MDT or SCCM for deployment, and set up deployment shares with drivers. Pre-migration tasks: full backup of user data (mandatory), document current configurations, create rollback plan if issues arise, and communicate timeline to users. Deployment methods: in-place upgrade for compatible machines (preserves data/apps), clean install for better performance (requires data migration), and use Windows Autopilot for new machines. Testing phase: deploy to IT team first, then 5-10 pilot users from different departments, document all issues and solutions, and refine process based on feedback. Post-migration: verify all applications working, restore user data and settings, provide quick reference guides for UI changes, and offer floor support for first week. Track metrics: document upgrade success rate, time per machine, and user satisfaction. Maintain detailed logs for troubleshooting and prepare monthly progress reports for management."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain Active Directory structure and how you'd troubleshoot authentication issues.",
      answer: "Active Directory uses a hierarchical structure: Forest at the top (security boundary), Domains within forests (administrative boundary), Organizational Units (OUs) for organizing objects, and objects like users, computers, and groups. Authentication flow: user enters credentials at workstation, Kerberos protocol authenticates against domain controller, ticket-granting ticket (TGT) issued for session, and service tickets granted for resource access. To troubleshoot authentication issues, check basic connectivity: ping domain controller by name and IP, verify DNS resolving DC correctly, and ensure time sync within 5 minutes. User account checks: verify account not locked or disabled, check password hasn't expired, ensure logon hours and workstation restrictions, and confirm user in correct groups. Test authentication: try different user account on same machine, try problem account on different machine, and use runas command to test credentials. Advanced diagnostics: check Event Viewer on DC for audit failures, use netdom to verify secure channel, run dcdiag on domain controllers, and verify Kerberos tickets with klist. Common fixes: reset computer account in AD, rejoin computer to domain, clear cached credentials, and update Group Policy. For trust issues: verify trust relationship with netdom, check SID history for migrated accounts, and ensure all DCs replicating properly. Document authentication paths and maintain DC health monitoring."
    },
    {
      question: "A user reports their computer displays a 'No boot device found' error. What are the potential causes and how would you troubleshoot this systematically?",
      answer: "This error indicates the BIOS/UEFI cannot find a bootable operating system. I'd start by checking the boot order in BIOS settings to ensure the correct drive is prioritized. Common causes include: loose SATA/M.2 connections (reseat cables and drives), failed hard drive (run diagnostics using manufacturer tools), corrupted boot sector (use Windows Recovery to run bootrec /fixboot and /fixmbr), incorrect BIOS settings (verify AHCI/RAID mode matches OS installation), or disabled boot device (check if drive appears in BIOS). For deeper issues, I'd boot from Windows installation media to access recovery tools, run chkdsk /f to check for disk errors, and use diskpart to verify partition structure. If the drive isn't detected in BIOS at all, it likely indicates hardware failure requiring replacement. I'd also check for recent hardware changes that might have affected boot configuration."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the differences between RAM types (DDR3, DDR4, DDR5) and how to identify compatibility issues when upgrading memory.",
      answer: "DDR generations differ in speed, voltage, and physical design. DDR3 operates at 1.5V with speeds from 800-2133MHz, DDR4 at 1.2V with 2133-3200MHz standard speeds, and DDR5 at 1.1V starting at 4800MHz. Each has different pin counts (DDR3: 240, DDR4/DDR5: 288) and notch positions preventing incorrect installation. To identify compatibility, I'd check: motherboard specifications for supported RAM type and maximum capacity, CPU memory controller limitations, number of available slots and maximum per-slot capacity, and whether dual-channel configuration is required. Tools like CPU-Z show current memory configuration, while the motherboard manual lists qualified vendor lists (QVL). Common issues include: mixing different speeds (system runs at slowest speed), incompatible timings causing instability, and exceeding chipset limitations. Always match existing RAM specifications when adding modules, and run memory diagnostics after installation to verify stability."
    },
    {
      question: "A laser printer is producing pages with vertical lines running down the entire length. What components would you check and in what order?",
      answer: "Vertical lines on laser printer output typically indicate issues with the imaging system. I'd troubleshoot in this order: First, print a cleaning page to remove toner buildup. If lines persist, I'd inspect the toner cartridge for damage or leaks - often scratches on the drum surface cause consistent lines. Next, I'd check the transfer roller for toner accumulation or damage, cleaning it with approved methods. The fuser assembly could have damage or debris causing lines during the heating process. For persistent issues, I'd examine the laser scanner unit for dust on mirrors or lens requiring careful cleaning. The charge roller (if separate from cartridge) might have damage or contamination. I'd also verify proper paper type settings as incorrect settings affect toner application. Documentation should include: line positions, whether lines appear on all print jobs, and if they're the same color as the print or different. Most issues resolve with cartridge replacement, but persistent problems indicate printer mechanism issues."
    },
    {
      question: "Describe proper ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) procedures when working on computer components and explain why each step is important.",
      answer: "ESD protection is critical as static discharge can damage sensitive components even without visible signs. Proper procedures include: Using an anti-static wrist strap connected to a grounded surface - this equalizes electrical potential between you and components. Working on anti-static mats provides a controlled discharge path for static buildup. Before handling components, touch a grounded metal surface to discharge static. Store components in anti-static bags which have a conductive outer layer creating a Faraday cage effect. Keep humidity between 40-60% as dry air increases static buildup. Remove components by edges, avoiding contact with pins or circuits. Never place components on carpeted or plastic surfaces which generate static. Power down and unplug systems before work, but keep power supplies connected to maintain ground reference. Avoid wearing static-generating clothing like wool or synthetic materials. These precautions matter because ESD damage can be immediate (complete failure) or latent (degraded performance over time), and components like RAM, CPUs, and expansion cards are particularly vulnerable."
    },
    {
      question: "A user cannot access a network share but can browse the internet. Walk through your troubleshooting process including specific commands and tools.",
      answer: "Since internet works, basic connectivity is functioning. I'd start by pinging the file server by both IP address and hostname to test basic connectivity and name resolution. If ping by IP works but hostname fails, it's a DNS issue - check with nslookup and ipconfig /all for DNS settings. Next, I'd verify SMB connectivity using 'net view \\\\servername' to list available shares. Common issues include: Windows Firewall blocking SMB ports (445, 139) - check Windows Defender Firewall rules. Credential problems - use 'net use * /delete' to clear cached credentials, then remap with correct username. Permission issues - verify user account has share and NTFS permissions on the server. Time synchronization - SMB requires synchronized clocks, check with w32tm /query /status. Network discovery disabled - ensure network profile is Private/Domain, not Public. I'd also check Event Viewer for specific error codes, verify the share exists and server service is running, and test with a different user account to isolate profile issues. Document successful access methods for future reference."

    // EASY QUESTIONS (1-5) - Basic customer support and troubleshooting
    {
      question: "A customer calls saying their internet is completely down. What are your first troubleshooting steps?",
      answer: "I'd start with basic power cycle troubleshooting. First, ask the customer to check all cable connections: ensure coax/ethernet cable is finger-tight at the modem, verify power cable is securely connected, and check that all cables are undamaged. Next, perform a modem reboot: unplug power for 30 seconds, plug back in and wait 3-5 minutes for full boot, observe the lights as they come on, and verify which lights are solid vs. blinking. Check modem indicators: power light should be solid green, online/DSL/PON light should be solid (if blinking, signal issue), WiFi lights indicate wireless is broadcasting, and ethernet lights show connected devices. If still down, check for service outages: verify account status is active, check for area outages in the system, look for scheduled maintenance, and see if neighbors are affected. Basic diagnostics: try connecting a laptop directly to modem with ethernet, test a different ethernet cable if available, check if customer can access modem interface (192.168.1.1), and document all lights status and troubleshooting done. If unresolved, schedule technician with notes about completed troubleshooting steps."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the process of setting up a new customer's internet service from the moment the ONT is installed to achieving full connectivity.",
      answer: "After physical ONT installation, I'd begin with ONT activation: verify fiber connection shows proper light levels (-15 to -25 dBm typical), ensure ONT is powered and POST completes successfully, and record ONT serial number and MAC address. In our provisioning system, I'd create the customer account with correct service tier, assign static or dynamic IP based on service level, configure VLAN tagging if required, and push configuration to ONT via TR-069 or OMCI. Next, configure customer router: set WAN to DHCP or PPPoE based on our network design, configure wireless SSID and security (WPA2/WPA3), set DNS servers (our servers or public DNS), and enable firewall with appropriate rules. Testing includes: verify ONT shows online in management system, confirm customer gets expected IP address, run speed tests to verify provisioned speeds, test browsing, streaming, and latency-sensitive applications, and check for IPv6 connectivity if supported. Finally, document configuration details, provide customer with network information, and schedule follow-up to ensure service stability."
    },
    {
      question: "A business customer reports their VoIP phones are experiencing poor call quality and drops. How would you diagnose and resolve this issue?",
      answer: "VoIP issues require checking QoS and network performance. First, I'd gather symptoms: frequency of drops, specific times of occurrence, number of simultaneous calls affected, and whether it affects all phones or specific ones. Network assessment includes: checking bandwidth utilization during calls (typically 80-100kbps per call), measuring jitter (should be <30ms), packet loss (should be <1%), and latency (should be <150ms one-way). I'd verify QoS configuration: ensure VoIP traffic is properly tagged (usually DSCP EF 46), confirm priority queuing is configured on router, check if traffic shaping is limiting VoIP packets, and verify VLAN configuration if voice is segregated. Physical layer checks: test ethernet cables to phones, verify PoE switch providing adequate power, check for duplex mismatches causing performance issues. Router/firewall inspection: confirm SIP ALG is disabled if causing issues, verify firewall rules allow RTP port ranges, check NAT timeouts for UDP traffic, and ensure router CPU isn't overloaded. Resolution might involve: implementing traffic prioritization, increasing bandwidth if saturated, replacing faulty network equipment, or coordinating with VoIP provider for codec optimization."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you help a customer connect a new device to their WiFi network?",
      answer: "I'd guide the customer through WiFi connection step-by-step. First, locate network credentials: find WiFi name (SSID) on modem sticker, locate password (may be called network key or passphrase), confirm if it's 2.4GHz or 5GHz network, and verify WiFi is enabled on modem (WiFi light on). On the device, access WiFi settings: for Windows, click WiFi icon in system tray, for Mac, click WiFi icon in menu bar, for phones, go to Settings > WiFi, and ensure WiFi is turned on. Connect to network: select correct network name from list, enter password exactly as shown (case-sensitive), choose 'Connect Automatically' if desired, and wait for connection confirmation. Troubleshooting connection issues: verify password is entered correctly, move closer to router for stronger signal, forget network and reconnect, and restart device if needed. For smart home devices: may only work on 2.4GHz networks, might need WPS button method, check manufacturer app requirements, and temporarily disable 5GHz if having issues. Document device MAC address if needed for access control and confirm internet access with a test website."
    },
    {
      question: "A customer's cable modem keeps losing connection every few hours. Walk through your diagnostic process including signal level interpretation.",
      answer: "Cable modem issues often relate to signal problems. I'd start by accessing modem diagnostics page (usually 192.168.100.1) to check signal levels. Downstream power should be between -10 to +10 dBm (optimal 0 to +5), upstream power should be 35-50 dBm, and SNR should be above 30 dB (higher is better). Check error counters: corrected errors indicate marginal signal, uncorrected errors suggest severe issues. Review modem logs for T3/T4 timeouts indicating upstream/downstream problems. Physical inspection includes: checking coax connections for corrosion or loose fittings, ensuring cable isn't kinked or damaged, verifying splitters aren't degraded (each splitter drops 3.5dB), and removing unnecessary splitters if signal is marginal. Environmental factors: check if disconnects correlate with temperature changes (thermal expansion), verify modem has adequate ventilation, and look for electrical interference from nearby devices. Network-side investigation: check CMTS logs for modem flapping, review area performance for node saturation, and verify modem firmware is current. Solutions might include: replacing corroded connectors, installing amplifier if signal too low, adding attenuator if signal too high, scheduling technician for line conditioning, or replacing modem if hardware failure suspected."

    // MEDIUM QUESTIONS (6-10) - More technical troubleshooting and configuration
    {
      question: "A customer wants to improve their WiFi coverage in their home. What basic solutions would you recommend?",
      answer: "I'd start by optimizing their current setup before suggesting new equipment. Router placement: move router to central location in home, elevate it off the floor (shelf or mount), keep away from walls and metal objects, and avoid interference from microwaves and baby monitors. Check current settings: ensure router firmware is updated, verify using appropriate WiFi channel (1, 6, or 11 for 2.4GHz), confirm transmit power is set to high, and check if both 2.4GHz and 5GHz are enabled. Simple solutions: adjust router antennas to vertical position, remove obstacles between router and devices, limit devices on network if overloaded, and restart router weekly for best performance. Range extension options: WiFi extender for single dead zone (easiest setup), mesh system for whole home coverage (best solution), powerline adapters for far rooms, and additional access point if ethernet available. Customer education: explain 2.4GHz (longer range) vs 5GHz (faster speed), show how to check signal strength on devices, recommend speed test apps, and explain when to restart equipment. Document current setup and recommended solutions, and offer follow-up if customer needs help with new equipment installation."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you set up port forwarding for a customer's security camera or gaming console?",
      answer: "Port forwarding requires careful configuration for the specific device. First, gather information: identify device's local IP address, determine required ports (check manual or manufacturer website), decide between TCP, UDP, or both protocols, and ensure device has static local IP. Access router configuration: open web browser and enter router IP (usually 192.168.1.1), log in with admin credentials, navigate to Port Forwarding or Virtual Server section, and look for Advanced or NAT settings. Configure port forward: enter device name for reference, input device's local IP address, enter external and internal port numbers (often the same), select protocol (TCP/UDP/Both), and enable or save the rule. Common examples: security cameras often use port 80/443/554, gaming consoles have specific ports per manufacturer, Minecraft server uses 25565, and remote desktop uses 3389. Test the configuration: use online port checker tools, try accessing from outside network, verify device is accessible, and troubleshoot if connection fails.

      question: "Describe the complete process of troubleshooting a fiber connection showing 'no light' at the customer's ONT.",
      answer: "No light at ONT indicates physical layer failure. Immediate checks: verify ONT has power and LED indicators are functioning, check fiber cable for visible damage or sharp bends (minimum bend radius 30mm), ensure fiber connector is clean and properly seated, and look for any obvious breaks in visible fiber runs. Cleaning procedure: use proper fiber cleaning kit (never tissues or alcohol alone), clean both the fiber connector and ONT port, use inspection scope to verify core is clean, and reconnect with firm but gentle pressure. Light level testing: use optical power meter to measure light at ONT location (should see -15 to -28 dBm typically), if no light, work backward toward distribution point, test at building entrance or fiber distribution hub, and document light levels at each point. Distribution network checks: verify fiber assignment in documentation matches physical connection, check optical splitter for proper connections and function, test from splitter input to verify feed from OLT, and inspect splice enclosures for damage or water ingress. OLT verification: confirm customer's port is enabled and configured, check OLT SFP status and light levels, verify VLAN and PON configuration, and review OLT logs for port flapping or errors. Escalation includes scheduling splice technician if break found, coordinating with outside plant for fiber repair, or replacing ONT if internal optics failed."

      question: "A customer reports their internet works fine during the day but becomes unusable every evening around 7 PM. How would you diagnose this congestion issue?",
      answer: "Peak hour degradation typically indicates network congestion. Data collection: run speed tests at various times documenting results, use continuous ping to monitor latency variations, check modem/ONT logs for errors during affected times, and gather traceroute results during good and bad periods. Customer-side investigation: verify no scheduled tasks (backups, updates) run at 7 PM, check if multiple users stream simultaneously, review router QoS settings for misconfigurations, and monitor customer's bandwidth usage in real-time. Network analysis: check node utilization reports for oversubscription, review CMTS/OLT port statistics for congestion, analyze area trouble tickets for patterns, and verify no maintenance windows overlap with issues. Signal quality correlation: monitor if signal levels change with temperature (evening cooling), check if upstream power increases during peak (indicates noise), review SNR variations throughout the day, and document any T3/T4 timeouts in modem logs. Bandwidth monitoring: use SNMP to graph customer's usage patterns, identify if hitting provisioned speed caps, check for buffer bloat during congestion, and analyze packet loss patterns. Resolution strategies: recommend upgrading to less congested service tier, implement customer QoS to prioritize critical traffic, schedule node split if area-wide congestion confirmed, or investigate dedicated business service if residential network oversubscribed. Provide detailed report with evidence and recommendations."

Emergency notifications: call power company emergency line first, notify all attached utilities, contact emergency management if road blocked, and alert supervisor for resource mobilization. Scene safety: place cones/flares at safe distance, never touch vehicle if wires contact, keep crowds away from danger zone, and wait for power company all-clear. Temporary stabilization: only if safe and trained to do so, use guy wires to prevent further lean, shore adjacent poles if affected, and document temporary measures taken. Power company coordination: provide clear location and pole number, describe all visible damage, confirm when power is isolated, and get written clearance to begin work. Assessment after de-energization: inspect pole for structural integrity, check adjacent poles for damage, evaluate all attachments for damage, and determine if emergency replacement needed. Emergency replacement: mobilize crew and equipment quickly, set new pole adjacent if possible, transfer facilities systematically, and maintain service where possible. Transfer procedures: work top-down (power first), coordinate with each utility, maintain temporary service if possible, and document transfer times. Restoration priorities: restore power first priority, emergency services next, major thoroughfares, then residential service. Final documentation: complete accident reports, document all damage and repairs, photograph before and after, coordinate with insurance, and update plant records immediately."

    // EASY QUESTIONS (1-5) - Basic fiber concepts and procedures
    {
      question: "Walk through the complete process of fusion splicing two fibers, including preparation and testing.",
      answer: "Fusion splicing requires precision and proper technique. Preparation begins with workspace setup: clean, stable surface away from wind and dust, proper lighting for visibility, fusion splicer on stable platform, and all tools organized and accessible. Cable preparation: measure and mark strip lengths accurately, score and remove outer jacket carefully, clean buffer tubes with appropriate wipes, and separate fibers without inducing stress. Fiber preparation: strip fiber using precision strippers (typically 1.25 inches), clean with 99% isopropyl alcohol and lint-free wipes, use one-directional cleaning motion, and inspect fiber end for contamination. Cleaving process: use precision cleaver with fresh blade position, ensure proper strip length in cleaver, apply consistent pressure for clean break, and inspect cleave angle (should be <0.5 degrees). Fusion process: place fibers in V-grooves carefully, ensure proper alignment in splicer, close wind cover before fusion, and observe arc fusion on screen. Quality checks: inspect splice on splicer screen, check estimated loss (should be <0.05dB), look for bubbles or alignment issues, and re-splice if not acceptable. Protection: slide heat shrink over splice point, place in heater for proper shrink time, ensure sleeve fully contracts, and allow cooling before handling. Splice tray management: route fibers maintaining bend radius, secure in designated slots, avoid crossing or tangling fibers, and label per documentation standards. Testing: perform OTDR test bi-directionally, verify splice loss within specifications, check for reflectance issues, and document all results. Common issues include contamination causing high loss, poor cleave angles, and incorrect fusion parameters."

    {
      question: "Explain how to use an OTDR to locate a fault in a fiber optic cable, including trace interpretation.",
      answer: "OTDR operation requires understanding of optical principles and trace interpretation. Initial setup: select appropriate wavelength (1310nm for general, 1550nm for long distance), set pulse width based on distance (shorter for accuracy, longer for distance), configure averaging time for noise reduction, and set appropriate distance range. Launch cable preparation: use minimum 500m launch cable, ensure clean connections throughout, match fiber type to system under test, and verify launch cable condition. Test execution: connect OTDR to launch cable, initiate trace acquisition, wait for averaging to complete, and save baseline trace for comparison. Trace interpretation basics: vertical axis shows power level (dB), horizontal axis shows distance, downward slopes indicate fiber attenuation, and sudden drops indicate events. Event identification: connectors show small loss with reflection, mechanical splices show loss with reflection, fusion splices show loss without reflection, and breaks show large loss with high reflection. Fault location: identify anomalous event on trace, note distance reading to event, account for cable slack (typically 3-5%), and consider cable routing for actual location. Advanced analysis: use two-point loss measurement, check event reflectance values, compare with baseline traces, and test from both directions for accuracy. Ghost detection: identify events beyond fiber end, recognize as reflections of real events, calculate actual location mathematically, and ignore in analysis. Macro-bend identification: appears as gradual loss increase, may not show reflection, common at incorrect storage, and verify with visual inspection. Documentation: save all traces with descriptive names, export data for reports, maintain historical records, and create event maps for reference."

      question: "Describe the different types of fiber optic connectors and their specific applications, including proper cleaning procedures.",
      answer: "Fiber connectors vary by application and require specific handling. SC connectors: push-pull design for easy connection, common in telecom applications, square housing prevents rotation, and typical loss 0.3dB or less. LC connectors: small form factor (half SC size), high-density applications, used in data centers, and similar push-pull mechanism. FC connectors: threaded coupling for stability, used in test equipment, prevents disconnection from vibration, and common in CATV applications. ST connectors: bayonet-style coupling, older installations, being phased out, and requires careful alignment. MPO/MTP connectors: multi-fiber (12, 24, or 72), high-density applications, critical for 40G/100G networks, and requires special cleaning tools. Cleaning procedures: inspect first with fiber scope (400x magnification), identify contamination type, never touch ferrule end face, and clean only when necessary. Dry cleaning method: use one-click cleaners for convenience, lint-free wipes for manual cleaning, figure-8 motion on cleaning surface, and single directional wipe only. Wet cleaning method: apply 99% IPA sparingly, follow with dry wipe immediately, use for stubborn contamination, and ensure complete drying. Specialized cleaning: MPO requires special tools, use appropriate cassette cleaner, clean alignment pins carefully, and inspect each fiber position. Contamination types: dust and dirt most common, oil from fingerprints difficult, dried alcohol leaves residue, and scratches permanent damage. Best practices: always cap unused connectors, inspect before and after cleaning, never reuse cleaning materials, and maintain cleaning supplies properly. Testing after cleaning: verify with optical power meter, check insertion loss specifications, test return loss if required, and document improvements."

    {
      question: "How do you calculate and design a fiber optic link budget, including loss considerations and power margins?",
      answer: "Link budget analysis ensures reliable optical transmission. Basic calculation: transmitter power minus receiver sensitivity equals available budget, subtract all losses from budget, remaining must exceed required margin (typically 3dB minimum). Loss components: connector losses (0.3-0.5dB each), fusion splices (0.05-0.1dB each), fiber attenuation (0.35dB/km at 1310nm, 0.25dB/km at 1550nm), and mechanical splices (0.1-0.3dB). Example calculation: transmitter power -3dBm, receiver sensitivity -28dBm, available budget 25dB, calculate total path losses. Fiber loss: 10km at 1310nm = 3.5dB, 4 connectors × 0.5dB = 2dB, 10 fusion splices × 0.1dB = 1dB, total losses = 6.5dB. Safety margin: available 25dB minus 6.5dB losses = 18.5dB margin, subtract 3dB repair margin, subtract 1dB aging margin, final margin 14.5dB acceptable. Wavelength considerations: use worst-case wavelength, consider chromatic dispersion limits, account for polarization mode dispersion, and verify for all operating wavelengths. Temperature effects: transmitter power variations, receiver sensitivity changes, fiber loss increases slightly, and typically 1-2dB allowance. Component aging: LED power decreases over time, laser degradation predictable, connector contamination over time, and plan for 1-2dB degradation. Repair allowance: account for future splices, emergency restoration needs, typically 3dB allowance, and more for critical links. Documentation required: create loss budget spreadsheet, include all component specifications, update with actual measurements, and maintain for troubleshooting. Verification testing: measure actual link loss, compare to calculated budget, investigate discrepancies, and establish baseline for monitoring."

Panel selection: determine required port count with growth, choose appropriate connector type (SC, LC), select proper mounting (rack or wall), and verify singlemode or multimode compatibility. Pre-installation planning: create labeling scheme beforehand, determine cable routing paths, plan slack storage requirements, and coordinate shutdown if needed. Mounting installation: secure panel at appropriate height, ensure adequate clearance for cables, verify structural support adequate, and maintain accessibility for maintenance. Cable preparation: measure cable length with slack, secure cable to rack properly, maintain bend radius throughout, and use appropriate cable ties. Cable entry: use proper cable clamps, provide strain relief, seal unused openings, and organize by direction or function. Fiber breakout: strip cable jacket carefully, separate buffer tubes methodically, maintain tube identification, and route to designated positions. Termination options: fusion splice pigtails (lowest loss), mechanical connectors (field installable), pre-terminated assemblies (fastest), and consider maintainability needs. Splice organization: use splice trays efficiently, maintain proper fiber routing, avoid fiber crossovers, and secure slack properly. Connector mounting: install adapters securely, verify proper orientation, clean all connections, and install dust caps. Cable management: use horizontal/vertical managers, maintain 30mm minimum bend radius, separate copper from fiber, and avoid over-tightening ties. Labeling requirements: label each port clearly, use permanent labeling method, follow TIA-606 standards, and document in spreadsheet. Testing procedures: test all connections with power meter, verify with OTDR if required, check polarity for duplex, and document all results. Final documentation: create panel layout diagram, maintain test records, photograph completed installation, and update network drawings."

    // MEDIUM QUESTIONS (6-10) - More complex fiber work and troubleshooting
    {
      question: "Describe the process of troubleshooting high optical loss in a fiber link, including systematic isolation techniques.",
      answer: "High loss troubleshooting requires systematic isolation approach. Initial verification: confirm loss measurement accurate, verify test equipment calibrated, check reference cables condition, and ensure proper test wavelength. Test setup validation: clean all test connections, verify launch conditions correct, check power meter settings, and establish new reference if needed. Baseline comparison: compare current to acceptance tests, review historical measurements, check for gradual degradation, and identify when problem started. Segment isolation: test individual segments separately, work from source outward, identify highest loss section, and focus troubleshooting there. Connector inspection: use fiber microscope 400x minimum, check for contamination or damage, clean if necessary, and re-test after cleaning. Common contamination: dust and dirt particles, fingerprint oils, dried cleaning fluids, and ferrule surface scratches. Splice investigation: locate splices with OTDR, check splice loss values, compare bi-directional measurements, and re-splice if excessive. Bend loss detection: look for localized losses on OTDR, check cable routing paths, verify bend radius compliance, and test at 1550nm (more sensitive). Environmental factors: temperature extremes affecting loss, moisture ingress possibilities, mechanical stress points, and vibration-induced problems. Connector problems: improper ferrule polish, cracked ferrules, contaminated adapters, and mismatched connector types. Cable damage: macro-bends from improper storage, micro-bends from tie wraps, crush damage from weight, and tensile damage from pulling. Testing methodology: use insertion loss testing first, follow with OTDR analysis, test bi-directionally always, and document each measurement. Resolution verification: re-test after repairs, compare to specifications, monitor for stability, and update documentation."

      question: "What are the different fiber optic cable types and their applications in various installation environments?",
      answer: "Fiber cable selection depends on environment and application requirements. Indoor cable types: riser-rated (OFNR) for vertical runs, plenum-rated (OFNP) for air spaces, low-smoke zero-halogen (LSZH) for confined spaces, and tight-buffer for direct termination. Outdoor cable types: loose-tube for temperature extremes, armored for direct burial, aerial self-supporting (ADSS), and figure-8 with messenger wire. Indoor/outdoor cables: dual-rated for transitions, eliminates splice points, water-blocked construction, and suitable for both environments. Loose-tube construction: gel-filled for water blocking, allows fiber movement, better for temperature cycles, and typically 250μm coating. Tight-buffer construction: 900μm buffer over fiber, easier to terminate, less preparation required, and common in premises. Armored variations: corrugated steel (CST) for rodents, aluminum tape (APL) for moisture, interlocking armor (ILA) for crush, and dielectric for lightning prone. Tactical cables: military applications, crush/abrasion resistant, deployable/retrievable, and chemical resistant. Submarine cables: special water blocking, pressure resistant design, armored for anchors, and repeater compatibility. Ribbon cables: multiple fibers in flat ribbon, high fiber density, mass fusion splicing, and data center backbone. Drop cables: flat or round construction, pre-connectorized options, weather resistant jacket, and flexible for routing. Fire ratings importance: plenum requires lowest smoke, riser for vertical shafts, general purpose limitations, and local code compliance. Environmental considerations: temperature rating range, UV resistance for outdoor, water/moisture blocking, and chemical compatibility. Fiber count selection: current plus growth needs, standard increments available, cost per fiber economics, and splice enclosure capacity."

      question: "Explain the differences between singlemode and multimode fiber, including when to use each type.",
      answer: "Understanding fiber modes determines application suitability. Singlemode characteristics: 9μm core diameter, single light path propagation, unlimited bandwidth potential, and yellow jacket typically. Multimode characteristics: 50μm or 62.5μm core, multiple light paths, limited bandwidth-distance product, and orange or aqua jacket. Distance capabilities: singlemode reaches 40km+ easily, multimode limited to 2km typically, depends on data rate, and wavelength dependent. Wavelength differences: singlemode uses 1310nm/1550nm, multimode uses 850nm/1300nm, CWDM/DWDM singlemode only, and wavelength determines attenuation. Bandwidth comparison: singlemode essentially unlimited, multimode limited by modal dispersion, OM3/OM4 improved bandwidth, and OM5 supports multiple wavelengths. Cost considerations: singlemode fiber costs less, singlemode electronics cost more, installation costs similar, and total system cost evaluation. Application guidelines: singlemode for long distance, carrier/ISP networks, CATV distribution, and high bandwidth needs. Multimode applications: enterprise LANs, data centers, short building runs, and cost-sensitive installations. Equipment compatibility: transceivers must match fiber, mode conditioning sometimes required, media converters available, and plan for future needs. Migration considerations: multimode to singlemode common, requires equipment replacement, plan during renovations, and maintain dual infrastructure. Testing differences: different test equipment needed, reference cables must match, wavelength selection critical, and mandrel wrap for multimode. Connector colors: blue for singlemode, beige for 62.5μm multimode, aqua for 50μm OM3/OM4, and green for APC singlemode. Mixing concerns: never mix in same link, high loss at junction, equipment damage possible, and clear labeling essential."

    {
      question: "Explain the difference between a switch and a router, and when you would use each.",
      answer: "A switch operates at Layer 2 (Data Link) and forwards frames based on MAC addresses within a local network. It creates separate collision domains for each port, learns MAC addresses dynamically, and maintains a MAC address table. Switches are used for: connecting devices in the same network/VLAN, providing dedicated bandwidth per port, and creating network segments. A router operates at Layer 3 (Network) and forwards packets based on IP addresses between different networks. It maintains routing tables, performs NAT, and provides security between networks. Routers are used for: connecting different networks/subnets, WAN connectivity and internet access, implementing security policies between segments, and traffic routing decisions. In practice: use switches for LAN connectivity within buildings/floors, deploy routers at network borders and WAN edges, and implement Layer 3 switches for inter-VLAN routing in larger networks. Modern equipment often combines functions - Layer 3 switches can route, and routers include switch ports."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you configure and troubleshoot VLANs on a managed switch?",
      answer: "VLAN configuration starts with planning: assign VLAN IDs (avoid VLAN 1 for security), document purpose of each VLAN (e.g., VLAN 10-Users, VLAN 20-VoIP), and plan IP addressing scheme. Access switch via console or SSH, enter configuration mode, and create VLANs: 'vlan 10', 'name Users'. Configure access ports: 'interface gi1/0/1', 'switchport mode access', 'switchport access vlan 10'. Configure trunk ports between switches: 'switchport mode trunk', 'switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30', and verify native VLAN matches. For inter-VLAN routing: configure router-on-a-stick or Layer 3 switch, create subinterfaces or SVIs, and assign IP addresses as default gateways. Troubleshooting commands: 'show vlan brief' to verify VLAN existence, 'show interfaces trunk' for trunk status, 'show mac address-table' for MAC learning, and 'show spanning-tree' for loop prevention. Common issues: VLAN mismatch on trunk links, forgotten 'no shutdown' on VLAN interface, native VLAN mismatch causing issues, and pruning removing needed VLANs. Best practices: use VLAN descriptions, implement VLAN pruning for security, and document all VLAN assignments."

      answer: "Starting with a /24 network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) giving us 256 addresses. To create 4 equal subnets, we need 2 bits for subnetting (2² = 4 subnets). Original: /24 = 255.255.255.0, New mask: /26 = 255.255.255.192 (borrowing 2 bits). Each subnet gets 64 addresses (2⁶ = 64): 62 usable hosts plus network and broadcast. The four subnets are: Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0/26 (0-63), network: .0, first host: .1, last host: .62, broadcast: .63. Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64/26 (64-127), network: .64, first host: .65, last host: .126, broadcast: .127. Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128/26 (128-191), network: .128, first host: .129, last host: .190, broadcast: .191. Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192/26 (192-255), network: .192, first host: .193, last host: .254, broadcast: .255. Practical application: assign subnets by department or function, configure router interfaces with first usable IP, update DHCP scopes for each subnet, and document subnet assignments. Remember: more subnets = fewer hosts per subnet, and plan for growth when subnetting."

      question: "How do you configure and verify a static route on a Cisco router?",
      answer: "Static routes are configured when dynamic routing isn't suitable or for specific traffic control. Configuration syntax: 'ip route [destination] [mask] [next-hop or exit-interface] [distance]'. Example: 'ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1' routes traffic for 10.10.10.0/24 network via 192.168.1.1. For default route: 'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1' sends all unknown traffic to 192.168.1.1. Using exit interface: 'ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 GigabitEthernet0/1' (faster lookup but proxy-ARP dependent). Floating static routes: add higher administrative distance, 'ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2 10', used as backup when primary fails. Verification commands: 'show ip route' displays routing table, 'show ip route static' shows only static routes, 'ping' and 'traceroute' to test connectivity, and 'show ip interface brief' for interface status. Troubleshooting: verify next-hop is reachable, check interface is up/up, ensure no more specific routes override, and watch for routing loops. Best practices: use descriptions for documentation, implement floating statics for redundancy, and regularly audit static routes for relevance."

DHCP provides: IP address and subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, and lease time. Server configuration includes: defining scope (IP range), excluding static IPs (servers, printers), setting lease duration, and configuring options (DNS, gateway). Common issues and fixes: No IP received - check VLAN configuration, verify DHCP service running, ensure scope has available IPs, and check for rogue DHCP servers. Wrong IP range - verify client in correct VLAN, check DHCP relay/helper configuration, and ensure scope options correct. IP conflicts - check for static IP overlaps, verify exclusions configured, and clear lease for conflicting address. Troubleshooting tools: 'ipconfig /release and /renew' on Windows, 'show ip dhcp binding' on Cisco, packet capture to see DORA process, and Event Viewer for DHCP server logs. DHCP relay for multiple subnets: configure 'ip helper-address' on router, points to DHCP server IP, and allows DHCP across VLANs. Best practices: use reservations for servers/printers, monitor scope utilization, and implement DHCP failover for redundancy."

      question: "How do you implement and troubleshoot spanning tree protocol (STP)?",
      answer: "STP prevents Layer 2 loops by blocking redundant paths. Process: elect root bridge (lowest bridge ID), calculate shortest path to root, and block redundant ports. Port states: Blocking (20 sec), Listening (15 sec), Learning (15 sec), Forwarding, or Disabled. Port roles: Root port (best path to root), Designated port (forwarding on segment), and Blocked/Alternate port (redundant path). Configuration: set bridge priority: 'spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096', configure root bridge: 'spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary', and enable portfast on access ports: 'spanning-tree portfast'. Verify with commands: 'show spanning-tree' for STP status, 'show spanning-tree summary' for overview, and 'debug spanning-tree' for real-time changes. Common issues: suboptimal root bridge selection (set priority manually), slow convergence (implement Rapid STP), and topology changes from flapping links. RSTP improvements: faster convergence (seconds vs 50 seconds), new port roles (alternate, backup), and backward compatible with STP. Best practices: manually set root bridge, use BPDU guard on access ports, implement root guard on distribution ports, and document expected topology. Advanced features: PVST+ for per-VLAN spanning tree, MST for multiple spanning tree instances, and loop guard for additional protection."

      question: "Describe how to configure and secure a wireless network with enterprise authentication.",
      answer: "Enterprise wireless uses 802.1X authentication with RADIUS for individual user credentials. Components needed: RADIUS server (Windows NPS or FreeRADIUS), certificate authority for EAP-TLS, wireless controller or access points, and Active Directory for user accounts. Configure RADIUS server: install Network Policy Server role, create RADIUS clients (APs/controllers), configure network policies for wireless access, and set authentication methods (PEAP-MSCHAPv2 or EAP-TLS). Wireless controller setup: configure SSID with WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise, point to RADIUS servers (primary and backup), set RADIUS secret (complex, matching server), and configure reauthentication timer. Certificate deployment: create certificate template for wireless, deploy via Group Policy to domain computers, or use PEAP for username/password only. Security enhancements: implement MAC filtering as secondary control, use dynamic VLAN assignment from RADIUS, enable management frame protection (802.11w), and configure rogue AP detection. Client configuration: select WPA2-Enterprise security, choose authentication method (PEAP or EAP-TLS), validate server certificate, and enter domain credentials. Troubleshooting: check RADIUS server Event Logs, verify certificate trust chain, test with 'ntradping' utility, and monitor wireless controller logs. Best practices: separate guest and corporate networks, implement certificate-based authentication where possible, and regularly rotate RADIUS secrets."

      question: "How do you configure and manage Quality of Service (QoS) for VoIP traffic?",
      answer: "QoS ensures voice traffic gets priority over data traffic for call quality. VoIP requirements: latency <150ms one-way, jitter <30ms, packet loss <1%, and bandwidth ~80-100kbps per call. Classification methods: mark traffic with DSCP values (EF/46 for voice), identify by port numbers (SIP 5060, RTP 16384-32767), or use access lists for IP ranges. Marking configuration: at phone: configure DSCP in phone settings, at switch: 'mls qos trust dscp' on voice ports, and at router: class-maps to identify traffic. Implement queuing: Priority queue (LLQ) for voice: 'priority percent 20', CBWFQ for other traffic classes, and police excessive traffic if needed. Switch configuration: enable QoS globally: 'mls qos', trust DSCP on trunk ports, and configure voice VLAN with CoS 5. Router configuration example: 'class-map VOICE', 'match dscp ef', then 'policy-map QOS-POLICY', 'class VOICE', 'priority percent 20'. Apply policy: 'interface GigabitEthernet0/1', 'service-policy output QOS-POLICY'. Verification: 'show policy-map interface' for statistics, 'show mls qos' on switches, and monitor call quality metrics. Best practices: don't over-provision priority queue, implement admission control, test during peak usage, and monitor drops and delays."

      question: "Explain OSPF routing protocol configuration and troubleshooting.",
      answer: "OSPF is a link-state protocol using Dijkstra's algorithm for best path calculation. Basic configuration: 'router ospf 1' (process ID), 'network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0', and 'router-id 1.1.1.1' (manual ID). OSPF areas: Area 0 is backbone (all areas must connect), stub areas reduce database size, and totally stubby areas block Type 3-5 LSAs. Network types: Broadcast (Ethernet, DR/BDR election), Point-to-point (no DR needed), and NBMA (Frame Relay, manual neighbors). Neighbor states progression: Down, Init, 2-Way, ExStart, Exchange, Loading, and Full. Troubleshooting commands: 'show ip ospf neighbor' for adjacencies, 'show ip ospf database' for LSDB, 'show ip route ospf' for learned routes, and 'debug ip ospf adj' for adjacency issues. Common problems: mismatched area IDs, different network types, MTU mismatch, and authentication mismatch. DR/BDR election: highest priority wins (default 1), highest router ID if tie, and set priority 0 to never become DR. Authentication: plain text (Type 1) or MD5 (Type 2), configured per interface. Cost manipulation: 'ip ospf cost' per interface, or 'auto-cost reference-bandwidth' globally. Best practices: use loopbacks for router IDs, summarize at area borders, and implement authentication."

      question: "How do you design and implement network segmentation for security?",
      answer: "Network segmentation isolates different security zones to limit breach impact. Design principles: identify data classification levels, group similar security requirements, minimize cross-zone traffic, and implement zero-trust approach. Common segments: DMZ for public-facing services, management network for infrastructure, user VLANs by department, server VLANs by application tier, IoT/BYOD isolated networks, and guest network completely separated. Implementation: use VLANs for Layer 2 separation, implement router/firewall between segments, configure ACLs for traffic control, and use private VLANs for additional isolation. Firewall rules: default deny between zones, explicitly allow required traffic, log all inter-zone connections, and implement IPS for threat detection. Access control: 802.1X for dynamic VLAN assignment, MAC authentication bypass for non-802.1X devices, captive portal for guest access, and NAC for compliance checking. Monitoring: NetFlow for traffic analysis, SIEM for security events, regular penetration testing, and configuration compliance auditing. Best practices: document all flows between segments, implement jump servers for administration, use separate credentials per zone, regularly review and update rules, and plan for east-west traffic inspection. Consider microsegmentation for critical assets using software-defined networking."

      question: "Design a redundant network architecture for a two-site business with 200 users.",
      answer: "Design dual-site architecture with high availability at each layer. Core/Distribution: redundant core switches at each site (stack or VSS), dual WAN routers for internet/MPLS, cross-connect between core switches (LACP), and Layer 3 at distribution for fast convergence. Site connectivity: primary MPLS circuit (10Gbps), secondary internet VPN (1Gbps), and automatic failover using IP SLA tracking. Routing design: OSPF or EIGRP internally, BGP for WAN if multiple carriers, summarization at site boundaries, and floating static routes for backup. Access layer: dual-uplink to distribution switches, spanning-tree root at distribution, and PoE+ for phones and wireless APs. Wireless: controllers at each site (HA pair), AP groups for local traffic switching, and FlexConnect for WAN survivability. Security: firewalls in HA active/standby, IPS at internet edge, and site-to-site VPN as backup. Internet edge: dual ISPs with BGP or failover, load balancing for outbound traffic, and public IP redundancy. Server infrastructure: virtualization cluster at primary site, replicated critical services at secondary, and stretched VLANs for vMotion if needed. Monitoring: centralized NMS at primary site, NetFlow collectors at both sites, and out-of-band management network. DR considerations: RPO/RTO requirements documented, automatic failover for critical services, and regular failover testing scheduled."

Basic setup: 'router bgp 65001', 'neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote-as 65002', 'network 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0'. eBGP vs iBGP: eBGP between different AS (TTL=1), iBGP within same AS (full mesh required), and use route reflectors for scalability. Path selection (in order): highest weight (local), highest local preference, originated locally, shortest AS path, lowest origin type, lowest MED, eBGP over iBGP, lowest IGP metric to next-hop, and lowest router ID. Advertising routes: network statement with exact match, redistribute from IGP (use route-maps), and aggregate-address for summarization. Filtering: prefix-lists for IP filtering, AS-path filters for AS-based, route-maps for complex policy, and communities for tagging routes. Troubleshooting: 'show ip bgp summary' for peer status, 'show ip bgp' for BGP table, 'debug ip bgp updates' for real-time, and 'clear ip bgp * soft' for policy changes. Common issues: incorrect peer IP or AS, MD5 authentication mismatch, filtered by policy, and next-hop unreachable.

Netmiko example: 'from netmiko import ConnectHandler', define device dictionary, 'net_connect = ConnectHandler(**device)', 'output = net_connect.send_command(\"show ip int brief\")'. REST API automation: authenticate and get token, make GET requests for data, POST/PUT for configuration, and handle JSON responses. Template approach: create Jinja2 templates for configs, define variables in YAML, render templates with data, and push to multiple devices. Error handling: try/except blocks for connection issues, validate before applying configs, rollback on failure, and log all actions. Ansible for orchestration: inventory file for devices, playbooks for tasks, roles for reusability, and vault for passwords. Version control: Git for script management, separate dev/prod branches, peer review process, and documentation in README. APIs to leverage: RESTCONF for standard-based, NETCONF for transaction support, vendor APIs (Meraki, DNA Center), and monitoring APIs (SNMP, streaming telemetry).

      question: "Explain implementing and managing a Windows Server failover cluster for SQL Server.",
      answer: "SQL Server clustering provides high availability for critical databases. Architecture types: Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) with shared storage, Always On Availability Groups (no shared storage), and combination for maximum protection. Prerequisites: Windows Server Enterprise, minimum 2 nodes (up to 64), shared storage (SAN/S2D), dedicated cluster networks, and Active Directory domain. Cluster installation: validate cluster configuration, create Windows cluster, configure quorum (disk/cloud witness), and assign cluster networks. Storage configuration: present LUNs to all nodes, configure MPIO for redundancy, initialize and format volumes, and add to cluster storage. SQL installation: install on first node, choose new cluster installation, specify cluster network name, configure TempDB on local SSD, and add additional nodes. Always On setup: enable Always On in SQL, create Availability Group, add databases to AG, configure replicas (sync/async), and set readable secondaries. Quorum configuration: Node and Disk Majority (odd nodes), Node Majority (even nodes), Disk Only (not recommended), and Cloud Witness (Azure). Network configuration: separate public/private networks, configure cluster heartbeat, disable NetBIOS on private, and set network priorities. Monitoring: cluster validation report, SQL Server dashboard, DMVs for Always On health, and Windows event logs. Failover testing: manual failover process, automatic failover validation, application connection testing, and recovery time measurement. Maintenance: rolling updates procedure, cluster aware updating, backup strategies, and capacity planning. Performance: optimize storage layout, network bandwidth sizing, TempDB configuration, and index maintenance."

      question: "How do you implement PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) for infrastructure management?",
      answer: "DSC ensures systems maintain desired configuration state. Architecture: push mode (simple, manual), pull mode (scalable, automatic), DSC resources (what to configure), and Local Configuration Manager (LCM). Configuration syntax: Configuration keyword block, Node definition for targets, Resource declarations, and MOF file generation. Built-in resources: File, Registry, Service, WindowsFeature, User, Group, and Package installation. Example configuration: 'Configuration WebServer { Node localhost { WindowsFeature IIS { Name = \"Web-Server\"; Ensure = \"Present\" } } }'. Compile and apply: generate MOF file, Start-DscConfiguration cmdlet, Test-DscConfiguration for compliance, and Get-DscConfiguration for current state. Pull server setup: install DSC service, configure IIS endpoint, SQL or EDB database, and certificate for HTTPS. Pull client configuration: configure LCM settings, specify pull server URL, registration key setup, and configuration names. Custom resources: class-based (PowerShell 5), MOF-based (legacy), resource designer tool, and publish to gallery. Composite resources: combine multiple resources, parameterized configurations, and reusable modules. Partial configurations: split large configs, different refresh modes, and dependency ordering. Azure Automation DSC: cloud-based pull server, hybrid worker support, built-in reporting, and change tracking. Monitoring: DSC event logs, pull server reports, Azure Log Analytics, and compliance dashboards. Best practices: source control for configurations, test in development, implement gradually, use composite resources, and document dependencies."

      question: "Describe implementing a comprehensive monitoring solution using System Center Operations Manager (SCOM).",
      answer: "SCOM provides end-to-end monitoring for Microsoft and third-party systems. Architecture: Management Server (MS) for processing, SQL database for data, Reporting Server (SSRS), Gateway servers for untrusted domains, and agents on monitored systems. Installation: size SQL Server appropriately, install management server, configure data warehouse, deploy reporting services, and open firewall ports. Management packs: import relevant MPs (Windows, SQL, Exchange), tune out noise, create custom monitors, and update regularly. Agent deployment: push from console, manual installation, System Center Configuration Manager, and agentless monitoring option. Discovery and monitoring: automatic discovery rules, computer and instance groups, monitor types (unit, dependency, aggregate), and rule types (alert, collection, event). Custom monitoring: create custom management pack, unit monitors for specifics, rules for event collection, diagnostics and recoveries, and knowledge articles. Distributed applications: create service models, component dependencies, health rollup, and synthetic transactions. Alerting: notification channels (email, SMS), subscribers and schedules, alert suppression, and escalation procedures. Reporting: built-in reports, custom report creation, scheduled report delivery, and dashboard creation. Integration: connect to Service Manager, forward to SIEM, PowerShell automation, and REST API usage. Network monitoring: SNMP device discovery, network device templates, port monitoring, and SNMP trap processing. Maintenance mode: planned maintenance windows, recursive maintenance, PowerShell automation, and scheduling options. Performance optimization: grooming settings, data warehouse retention, agent performance, and management pack tuning. Best practices: implement gradually, disable unnecessary rules, regular MP updates, document customizations, and train operations team."
