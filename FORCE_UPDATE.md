# URGENT: CodeSandbox Update Required

## Your CodeSandbox is running OLD code!

The error you're seeing at line 73 (`throw new Error('Registration successful but login failed')`) was already removed.

## Force Update CodeSandbox:

### Option 1: In CodeSandbox Terminal
```bash
git pull origin master
npm install
```
Then restart the server.

### Option 2: Fork Fresh
1. Go to: https://github.com/johnnyb439/cagadvisor
2. Click "Code" â†’ "Open with CodeSandbox"
3. This creates a fresh sandbox with latest code

### Option 3: Manual File Update
Replace the content of `app/register/page.tsx` at lines 70-102 with the code from GitHub.

## The error is ALREADY FIXED in the repository!

Check the latest code here:
https://github.com/johnnyb439/cagadvisor/blob/master/app/register/page.tsx

Line 73 now has a comment, NOT the error throw!
