# Session Resume Point - August 8, 2025

## üéØ WHERE WE LEFT OFF

   - OSP ‚úÖ (15 questions - properly organized)
   - Network ‚úÖ (20 questions - already had organization)
   - Systems ‚úÖ (20 questions - already had organization)
   - Fiber ‚úÖ (14 questions - properly organized)

2. **Fixed technical issues:**
   - Escaped backslashes in file paths (C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop)
   - Added section comments for all difficulty levels
   - Tested application - working on port 3002

3. **Created backup files:**
   - `INTERVIEW_PROGRESS_2025-08-08.md` - Full progress report

## üöÄ NEXT TASK: ADD MORE QUESTIONS

- **Fiber**: 14 questions (could add 6-11 more)

### File to Edit:

```

### Structure to Follow:
```typescript
category: [
  // EASY QUESTIONS (1-5) - Basic concepts
  { question: "...", answer: "..." },

  // HARDER QUESTIONS (11-15+) - Complex scenarios
  { question: "...", answer: "..." },
]
```
