**Date:** 2025-08-01 16:31:59  
**Checkpoint Name:** auth_fixed_dashboard_working_20250801_163159

## 🎯 Summary
This checkpoint captures the website state after successfully fixing the authentication system and getting the dashboard working properly with NextAuth.

## ✅ Key Changes
1. **Fixed dashboard authentication** - Migrated from localStorage to NextAuth session management
2. **Updated environment variables** - NEXTAUTH_URL now correctly points to port 3004
3. **Dashboard session handling** - Now uses `useSession` hook from next-auth/react
4. **Working auth flow** - Both login and registration functioning properly

## 🧪 Test Accounts
```
Email: test@test.com
Password: test

Email: testtest@test.com  
Password: testtest12
```

## 📝 Modified Files
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated to use NextAuth session instead of localStorage
- `.env.local` - Updated NEXTAUTH_URL to http://localhost:3004
- `data/users.json` - Contains two test user accounts

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\0_1_A_Dev\0_2_ClaudeCode_Live Project\cleared-advisory-group-website-local-backups\checkpoint_20250731_200444"

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Access the site at http://localhost:3004
```

## 🔍 What's Working
- User registration with all fields
- User login with credentials
- Dashboard access control via NextAuth
- Session persistence
- Logout functionality
- Protected routes middleware

## 📌 Notes
- The server will run on port 3004 (ports 3000-3003 were in use)
- Make sure NEXTAUTH_URL matches the actual port if it changes
- Authentication uses local JSON file storage (data/users.json)
- Passwords are properly hashed with bcrypt
