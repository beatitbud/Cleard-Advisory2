# üß™ Testing Account Registration in CodeSandbox

## How It Works Now

Registration is **ENABLED** in CodeSandbox! Here's what happens:

1. **Register a new account** at: https://dfv3s6-3000.csb.app/register
2. Account is saved **in memory** (not in files)
3. You can immediately **login** with the new account
4. Account persists until server restarts

## Test the Registration Flow

### Step 1: Register a Test Account
1. Go to: https://dfv3s6-3000.csb.app/register
2. Fill in:
   - **Name**: Any name (e.g., "Test User")
   - **Email**: Any email (e.g., "test@example.com")
   - **Password**: At least 8 characters
   - **Clearance Level**: Select any option
   - **Check** the terms checkbox
3. Click **"Create Account"**

### Step 2: Verify Registration
- You should see a success message
- You'll be redirected to login or dashboard

### Step 3: Test Login
1. Go to: https://dfv3s6-3000.csb.app/login
2. Login with the email and password you just created
3. You should successfully login!

### Step 4: Check Registered Users
Visit: https://dfv3s6-3000.csb.app/api/auth/users

This shows all currently registered users in memory.

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Users are stored in memory only!**
- They persist during the current session
- They're lost when the server restarts
- Perfect for testing!

## Test Multiple Accounts

Try registering several accounts:
1. `user1@test.com` / `password123`
2. `user2@test.com` / `password456`
3. `admin@test.com` / `admin789`

Each one should:
- Register successfully
- Be able to login
- Show in the users list

## Troubleshooting

### "User already exists"
- That email is already registered in this session
- Try a different email

### Can't login after registration
- Check you're using the exact email/password
- Check the users list to confirm registration

### Lost all users
- Server restarted (normal behavior)
- Just register new test accounts

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Registration form submits without errors
‚úÖ Success message appears
‚úÖ Can login with new account immediately
‚úÖ Account shows in /api/auth/users
‚úÖ Multiple accounts can be created

## The Flow Works! üéâ

The registration feature is fully functional for testing in CodeSandbox!
