# ðŸŽ‰ CodeSandbox + Claude Connected!

## Your Setup:
- **Sandbox ID**: epic-worker
- **Sandbox URL**: https://codesandbox.io/p/github/johnnyb439/cagadvisor/draft/epic-worker
- **VS Code Extension**: Installed âœ…

## Complete Connection in VS Code:

### If Sign-In Window Appeared:
1. Sign in with your CodeSandbox account
2. Authorize VS Code

### Then Connect to Sandbox:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type: **CodeSandbox: Open Sandbox**
3. Enter: **epic-worker**
4. Press Enter

## How It Works Now:

### You (with Claude):
- Edit files in VS Code locally
- Claude helps you code
- Changes auto-sync to CodeSandbox

### Your Colleague (Mac):
- Opens: https://codesandbox.io/p/github/johnnyb439/cagadvisor/draft/epic-worker
- Sees your changes in real-time
- Can edit simultaneously
- Their changes sync back to you

## Test the Connection:

1. In VS Code, open any file (like `app/page.tsx`)
2. Make a small change (like changing text)
3. Save the file (`Ctrl+S`)
4. Check CodeSandbox in browser - should update in 2-3 seconds!

## Share with Colleague:

Send them this message:
```
Hey! Our project is ready for collaboration on CodeSandbox!

Link: https://codesandbox.io/p/github/johnnyb439/cagadvisor/draft/epic-worker

Just open that link and you can:
- Edit code in your browser
- See my changes in real-time
- Preview the live site
- No setup needed on your Mac!

I'm editing in VS Code with Claude, and all my changes will appear instantly for you.
```

## Troubleshooting:

### If "Open Sandbox" Doesn't Work:
1. Make sure you're signed in first
2. Try the sandbox ID without spaces: `epic-worker`
3. Refresh VS Code and try again

### If Changes Don't Sync:
1. Check bottom of VS Code for CodeSandbox status
2. Make sure you saved the file
3. Check your internet connection

## You're All Set!
Claude can now edit files locally and they'll sync to CodeSandbox where your colleague can collaborate!
