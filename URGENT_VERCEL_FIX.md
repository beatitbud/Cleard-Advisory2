# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Vercel Authentication

## The Problem
Vercel hasn't pulled the latest code from GitHub that contains the auth fixes.

## Immediate Actions Required

### Option 1: Force Redeploy (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/johnny-bouphavongs-projects/cagadvisor
2. Click on the **"Deployments"** tab
3. Find the latest deployment
4. Click the **three dots (...)** menu
5. Select **"Redeploy"**
6. In the dialog, click **"Redeploy"** again

### Option 2: Trigger via Git (If Option 1 doesn't work)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/johnny-bouphavongs-projects/cagadvisor/settings/git
2. Check if it's connected to `johnnyb439/cagadvisor`
3. If not connected, click **"Connect a Git Repository"**
4. Select the `cagadvisor` repository

### Option 3: Manual Deploy via Import
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
3. Enter: `https://github.com/johnnyb439/cagadvisor`
4. Deploy as new project (you can delete the old one later)

## Environment Variables (MUST BE SET!)
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://cagadvisor.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=cag2025secureverceldeploymentkey
AUTH_SECRET=cag2025secureverceldeploymentkey
NODE_ENV=production
```

## After Deployment
Test with these credentials:
- **Email**: demo@cagadvisor.com / **Password**: demo123
- **Email**: admin@cagadvisor.com / **Password**: admin123

## Verification
Once deployed, check:
https://cagadvisor.vercel.app/api/test-auth

This should show the environment status.

## If Still Not Working
The issue might be:
1. Environment variables not set
2. Old deployment cached
3. GitHub webhook not triggering
