# ðŸš¨ Emergency Deployment Guide

## While Waiting for Vercel to Update

### Test These URLs on Vercel:
1. **Test Page**: https://cagadvisor.vercel.app/test
2. **API Status**: https://cagadvisor.vercel.app/api/test-auth
3. **Homepage**: https://cagadvisor.vercel.app

### If Still Getting 404:

## Option 1: Deploy to Netlify NOW (2 minutes)
```powershell
# Run this in PowerShell
.\quick-netlify-deploy.ps1
```

## Option 2: Share Your Local Version (1 minute)
```powershell
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2  
.\share-with-ngrok.ps1
```
Share the ngrok URL with your colleague!

## Option 3: Use CodeSandbox (Instant)
1. Go to: https://codesandbox.io/p/github/johnnyb439/cagadvisor
2. It will automatically deploy
3. Share the preview URL

## What's Happening with Vercel?

The 404 error could be because:
1. **Build is still in progress** - Check: https://vercel.com/johnny-bouphavongs-projects/cagadvisor
2. **Cache issues** - Clear browser cache or use incognito mode
3. **Wrong URL** - Make sure it's `cagadvisor` not `caglive`

## Quick Check:
Try this URL first: https://cagadvisor.vercel.app/api/test-auth

If this works (shows JSON), then the deployment is fine and it's just a routing issue.

## Need It Working NOW?

Run this for instant deployment:
```powershell
npm install -g surge
npm run build
surge .next --domain your-project-name.surge.sh
```

This gives you a URL in 30 seconds!
